                             Release Notes for
                            Perforce Git Fusion

                                  2012.2

Introduction

    Git Fusion provides a bidirectional gateway between Perforce and Git.

    Through the Git Fusion, Git users see the Perforce server as a
    Git remote repository.

    Perforce numbers releases YYYY.R/CCCCCC, for example, 2012.1/40716.
    YYYY is the year; R is the release of that year; CCCCCC is the
    bug fix change level.  Each bug fix in these release notes is
    marked by its change number.  Any build includes (1) all bug fixes
    of all previous releases and (2) all bug fixes of the current
    release up to the bug fix change level.

    Please send all feedback to support@perforce.com.

Installation

    Installation instructions are in the Git Fusion Administrator's Guide.

Installed Components

    The Git Fusion installation consists of one directories and this
    release notes file:
    * bin/                  Python scripts to implement most of Git Fusion
    * git-fusion-notes.txt  This file

Uninstalling Git Fusion

    To remove Git Fusion data from the Perforce server and corresponding
    repos from the Git Fusion server:
    * On the Git Fusion server, using the same unix account that runs
      Git Fusion, run 
         p4gf_delete_repo.py <viewname>    # to delete one view and its repo
         p4gf_delete_repo.py -a            # to delete all views, all repos

    To uninstall Git Fusion application
    * delete the git-fusion/bin/ directory
    * delete /etc/git-fusion.log.conf    

Updating From Previous Version of Git Fusion:

    1. If you lack the required versions of Python, P4Python, or other
       requirements, install those first. 
       New for Git Fusion 2012.2: Python 3.2.x now required.
    2. Download the git-fusion.tgz file to your Git Fusion server
       and expand.
    3. Copy the contents of its bin/ directory over the previous
       version of Git Fusion. This is usually somewhere such as
       /usr/local/git-fusion/bin/ .
       Usually requires sudo.
    4. Make all bin/*.py files world-executable:
       chmod a+x *.py

License

    See bin/LICENSE for the license to Git Fusion's source code.

Known Limitations and Behaviors

    * Streams and unicode enabled servers are not supported in this
      version of the Git Fusion.

    * Merge commits are not supported: Git history must be linear.
