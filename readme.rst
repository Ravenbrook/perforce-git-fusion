Ravenbrook customisations to Perforce Git Fusion
================================================

Ravenbrook is experimenting with the excellent Perforce Git Fusion
<http://www.perforce.com/product/components/git-fusion> that allows
Perforce and Git to work together.  Our goals are:

  1. to maintain GitHub repositories for our various open source
     projects maintained in our Perforce repository
     
  2. to have Git available locally as a tool

Ravenbrook operates its servers on FreeBSD, so rather than run a Linux
OVA we are installing and running the Git Fusion scripts directly on
FreeBSD.

This repository contains our local customisations to make this possible.
