    Perforce -- the Fast Software Configuration Management System.

    Git Fusion provides special commands that you can use with git clone, 
    git fetch, git pull, or git push to retrieve additional information.
    The commands are:
        @help  Show special command help
        @info  Show Git Fusion version information
        @list  Show repositories and actions available to you, based on 
               group permissions.
                - "pull" indicates you can pull information to the repo but 
                   require an authorized pusher
                - "push" indicates you can pull to and push from the repo
                
    Use a special command in place of the repo while running a clone, fetch,
    pull, or push. For example, to get version information, run:
        git clone p4gf@10.0.0.1:@info
    
    Note: Because the special command is not a valid repo, the Git command 
    terminates with the sentence: 
        fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
