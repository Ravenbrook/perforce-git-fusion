# Git Fusion log configuration
#
# Where and when should Git Fusion report events?
#

# -- Where to write log -------------------------------------------------------

# Logging to file?
#
# The filename may include the following keyword parameters:
# %(user)s -- user's home directory
# %(tmp)s  -- system temporary directory
#
# file   : %(user)s/p4gf_log.txt

# When logging to file, you can control the format:
#
# format : %(asctime)s %(name)-22s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s
# datefmt: %m-%d %H:%M:%S

# Logging to syslog or rsyslog?
#
# Ignores format and datefmt.
# Disables logging to file.
#
# Logs to syslog facility "user", at various priority levels depending on
# "What to write" later in this config file. Make sure you configure your
# /etc/rsyslog.conf or /etc/syslog.conf to include events for facility "user"
# at whatever priority levels you want recorded.
#
# Unless you have syslog listening on UDP port 514, you probably need to
# specify a log "address" that is really your syslog's input "file". For most
# linuxes, this is /dev/log. For Mac OS X, this is /var/run/syslog.
#
# handler: syslog /dev/log
#  or 
# handler: syslog /var/run/syslog
handler: syslog /dev/log

# Logging to console?
#
# Disables logging to file.
#
# handler: console

# -- What to write in the log -------------------------------------------------

# Levels control log detail level. "debug" is very detailed, but makes logs
# huge: several MB for each operation. "warning" is usually the best level:
# you still see when something goes wrong.
#
# Levels:
#   debug     Most detailed. Several MB of log data for each operation.
#   info      Very little data.
#   warning   Something not quite right, Git Fusion will attempt to recover.
#   error     Something wrong, Git Fusion cannot recover.
#   critical  Not used in Git Fusion.

# This is the default logging level for all events.
root                    : warning


# Override root's default for a few specific levels.

# This script is called by a cron job once per minute. Recording it at debug
# is too noisy. Doubly so if you already log cron jobs elsewhere.
#
p4gf_auth_update_authorized_keys  : warning

# Records (almost) every single shell or git command issued by Git Fusion
# at "debug" level if command exits exit code 0, or at "error" level if
# command exits with non-zero exit code. This is usually too much detail, so
# leave at "info" or higher to squelch.
#
cmd                     : warning

# Subcategories for shell and git command results, inherit the setting for
# "cmd" unless overridden here:
#
# cmd.exit              # exit code, usually 0 if ok, non-zero if error
# cmd.out               # stdout
# cmd.err               # stderr

# Git Fusion version information is recorded at level "info" for each
# operation. Useful mostly if you frequently upgrade your Git Fusion server
# and want that version information recorded in the log for debugging or bug
# reporting later.
#
version                 : warning

# P4PORT, P4USER, P4CLIENT, and other Perforce connection information is
# recorded at level "info" for each Git Fusion operation. 
#
context                 : warning

# Internal performance timers: record at level "debug" some detailed timing
# durations during pull or push operations. Show where the time (other than
# the actual git portion of pull or push) goes.
# 
p4gf_copy_to_git.time   : warning
p4gf_copy_to_p4.time    : warning

# Internal locks record at level "debug". These prevent multiple simultaneous
# operations from corrupting Git Fusion.
p4gf_lock               : warning

# Other log categories exist, usually one for each Git Fusion module.
# See git-fusion/bin/*.py for a likely list of module names.
